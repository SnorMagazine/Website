## Usage

We post all of the code that used in the various web experiments we put online.  We are a (loosely associated) school orgainzation, and believe in education, so we publish our code so it can be learned from.  That said in this repository there is a disto of Kirby, **WE DO NOT OWN KIRBY**.  We have a purchased license, if you would like to use Kirby please purchase it.  Information about Kirby is in the /php folder.

## How we host 
We use OpenShift <https://www.openshift.com> to host our our online presence. It is a PaaS offered by RedHat, and at our scale it is free.  OpenShift deploys via git, hence the unconventional file structure. Visit their website to learn more about OpenShift.
